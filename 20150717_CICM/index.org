* Introduction: *Lean*

- New *open source* theorem prover
- Platform for
  - *Software* verification & development
  - Formalized *mathematics*
  - *Education* (mathematics, logic, computer science)
  - *Synthesis* (proofs & programs)
- de Bruijn's Principle: *small trusted kernel*
- Expressive logic
- Partial constructions: automation fills the "holes"

* Introduction: *Lean*

- It is an ongoing and *long long term* effort
- At CMU, it is already being used for formalizing
  - Homotopy Type Theory
  - Category Theory
  - Algebraic Hierarchy
  - [[https://github.com/javra/msc-thesis][Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]]
  - Number Theory
- [[http://leanprover.github.io/tutorial][Interactive theory proving course]] at CMU
- Haitao Zhang is formalizing [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/theories/group_theory/group_theory.md][Group Theory]]

* Main Goal

*Lean aims to bring two worlds together*

- An interactive theorem prover with powerful automation
- An automated reasoning tool that
  - produces (detailed) proofs,
  - has a rich language,
  - can be used interactively, and
  - is built on a verified mathematical library

* Secondary Goals

- *Minimalist* and *high-performace* kernel

- *Experiment* with different flavors of type theory
  - Proof irrelevant vs Proof relevant
  - Impredicative vs Predicative
  - Higher Inductive Types
  - Quotient Types
  - Observational Type Theory

- *Education*
  - Interactive courses
  - *Proving* should be as easy as *programming*

- *Have Fun*

* Software verification and @@html:<br>@@ Formalized Mathematics

- Similar problems
  - *Proof stability*
  - Libraries are big
  - *Scalability* issues
  - Finding existing functions/theorems

- Common problems in software engineering:
  - Every attempt to create a single unified language failed (ADA?)
  - We keep reimplementing the same libraries over and over again
  - Mixing libraries from different languages is usually a mess
  - *Bit rotting*

- These problems also affect formalized mathematics

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle
  - Higher-order unification
  - Definitional reductions
  - Coercions
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (aka overloading)
  - Type classes
  - Tactics

* Dependent Type Theory

- Before we started Lean, we have studied different theorem
  provers: ACL2, Agda, Automath, Coq, HOL (family), Isabelle, Mizar, PVS

- *Dependent type theory* is really *beautiful*

- Some advantages
  - Built-in computational interpretation
  - Same data-structure for representing proofs and terms
  - Reduce code duplication, example:
    - We implemented a compiler for Haskell-like recursive equations,
      we can use it to construct proofs by induction
  - Mathematical structures (such as Groups and Rings) are first-class citizens

- Some references
  - [[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/in_praise_of_dependent_types.html][In praise of dependent types]] (Mike Shulman)

* Dependent Type Theory

- Constants
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
bool, nat, list, tree
#+END_SRC

- Function applications
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
(fact n), (vector nat 10), (x + y)
#+END_SRC

- Lambda abstractions
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
λ x : nat, x + 1
λ (n : nat) (v : vector nat n), cons 0 v
#+END_SRC

- Function spaces
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
nat → nat
Π (n : nat), vector nat n → vector nat (n+1)
#+END_SRC

* Dependent Type Theory

- What is the type of =nat=?
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
nat : Type
#+END_SRC

- What is the type of =Type=?
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
Type : Type
#+END_SRC
Is Lean inconsistent? *NO*

- Lean has a noncumulative universe hierarchy
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
Type.{0} : Type.{1} : Type.{2} : Type.{3} : ...
#+END_SRC

- Supports *universe polymorphism*
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
λ (A : Type.{u}) (a : A), a
#+END_SRC

- In ordinary situations you can ignore the universe parameters and simply write =Type=,
  leaving the "universe management" to Lean

* Propositions as types

- Propositions are types
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
∃ x : nat, x > 2
#+END_SRC

- The inhabitants/elements of a proposition =P= are the proofs of =P=

- =Prop= is the type of all propositions

* Kernel

- Kernel is implemented in two layers for easy customization

- 1st layer, dependent lambda calculus + options:
  - Proof irrelevance
  - Impredicative Prop
  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  Π (x : nat), x = x  -- is a Proposition
  ∀ (x : nat), x = x  -- Alternative notation
  #+END_SRC

- 2nd layer: Inductive families, Quotient types, HITs

#+attr_html: :height 300px
[[./img/kernel.png]]

* Two official libraries

- *Standard*
  - Proof irrelevant and impredicative Prop
  - Smooth transition to classical logic
  - Inductive Families
  - Quotient Types

- *HoTT*
  - Proof relevant and no impredicative Prop
  - Univalence axiom
  - Inductive Families
  - HIT

- Easy to implement experimental versions,
  Example: [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/523][Steve Awodey asked for proof relevant and impredicative universe]]

* Agnostic Mathematics

- Support *constructive* and *classical* mathematics
- *Constructive* results are *more informative*
- Computation is important to mathematics

- *Core* parts of the standard library are *constructive*

- *Separation of concerns*:
  - Methods to write computer programs
  - Freedom to use a nonconstructive theories and methods to reason about them

* Agnostic Mathematics

- *Semi constructive axioms*:
  - Function extensionality
  - Proposition extensionality
  - Quotient types (implies function extensionality)
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
    funext:  (∀ x, f x = g x) → f = g
    propext: (p ↔ q) → p = q
#+END_SRC

- Acceptable classical axiom: proof irrelevant excluded middle

- *Anti constructive*: Hilbert's choice (aka magic)
  - consequence: all propositions are decidable

* *Freedom to trust*

- Option: type check imported modules.

- *Macros*: semantic attachments for speeding up type checking and evaluation.
- Macros can be eliminated (expanded into pure Lean code).
- Each macro provides a function for computing the type and evaluating an instance.
- Each macro can be assigned a *trust level*.
- Many applications: interface with the GNU multiprecision arithmetic (GMP) library.

* Freedom to trust

- *Relaxed* mode

  - Trust the imported modules have not been tampered
  - Trust all macros

- *Paranoid* mode

  - Retype check all imported modules (someone may have changed the binaries)
  - Expand all macros (the developers may have made mistakes, GMP may be buggy)

- *Stronger guarantee* Retype check everything using Lean reference type checker

  - Daniel Selsam is implementing a [[https://github.com/leanprover/tc][reference type checker]] in Haskell

* Exporting libraries

- All Lean files can be exported in a very simple format

- [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/export_format.md][Documentation is available on github]]

- Communicate with other tools

- Interface with the [[https://github.com/leanprover/tc][Lean reference type checker]]

* Inductive families

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
    inductive nat : Type :=
    | zero : nat
    | succ : nat → nat
#+END_SRC

#+attr_html: :height 260px
[[./img/inductive.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
nat       : Type
nat.zero  : nat                  -- constructor
nat.succ  : nat → nat            -- constructor
nat.rec   : Π (C : nat → Type),  -- recursor
   C nat.zero → (Π (a : nat), C a → C (nat.succ a)) →
   n → C n
-- Computational rules
nat.rec C v f nat.zero      ==> v
nat.rec C v f (nat.succ n)  ==> f n (nat.rec C v f n)
#+END_SRC

* Inductive families

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
definition add (x y : nat) : nat :=
nat.rec (λ n, nat) x (λ n r, succ r) y

abbreviation C := λ n, nat
abbreviation s := succ
abbreviation z := zero
abbreviation f := λ n r : nat, succ r

  add (s z) (s (s z)) = nat.rec C (s z) f (s (s z))
                ...   = s (nat.rec C (s z) f (s z))
                ...   = s (s (nat.rec C (s z) f z))
                ...   = s (s (s z))
#+END_SRC

* Inductive families

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
inductive vector (A : Type) : nat → Type :=
| nil  : vector A zero
| cons : Π {n}, A → vector A n → vector A (succ n)
#+END_SRC

* Inductive families

- It is possible to *construct* a substantial *edifice of mathematics* based
  on nothing more than the *type universes*, *function spaces*, and
  *inductive types*; everything else follows from those.

* Implicit arguments

  - *Curly braces* indicate that argument should be *inferred* rather
    than entered explicitly.

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  definition id {A : Type} (a : A) : A :=
  a

  check id 10      -- @id num 10
  check @id num 10
  #+END_SRC

* Implicit arguments

  - Elaborator uses *higher-order unification*.

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  check @eq.subst
  -- eq.subst : ∀ {A : Type} {a b : A} {P : A → Prop},
  --            a = b → P a → P b
  variables (A : Type)  (R : A → A → Prop)
  variables (a b c : A) (f : A → A → A)

  example (H₁ : R (f a a) (f a a)) (H₂ : a = b) :
          R (f a b) (f b a) :=
  eq.subst H₂ H₁

  example (H₁ : R (f a a) (f a a)) (H₂ : a = b) :
          R (f a b) (f b a) :=
  @eq.subst A a b (λ x : A, R (f a x) (f x a)) H₂ H₁
  #+END_SRC


* Recursive equations

  - *Recursors* are *inconvenient* to use.
  - Compiler from *recursive equations* to *recursors*.
  - Two compilation strategies: *structural* and *well-founded* recursion

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  definition fib : nat → nat
  | fib 0     := 1
  | fib 1     := 1
  | fib (a+2) := fib (a+1) + fib a

  example (a : nat) : fib (a+2) = fib (a+1) + fib a :=
  rfl
  #+END_SRC

* Recursive equations

  - Proofs by induction

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  theorem fib_pos : ∀ n, 0 < fib n
  | fib_pos 0     := show 0 < 1, from zero_lt_succ 0
  | fib_pos 1     := show 0 < 1, from zero_lt_succ 0
  | fib_pos (a+2) := calc
      0 = 0 + 0             : rfl
    ... < fib (a+1) + 0     : lt_right (fib_pos (a+1)) 0
    ... < fib (a+1) + fib a : lt_left  (fib_pos a) (fib (a+1))
    ... = fib (a+2)         : rfl
  #+END_SRC

* Recursive equations

 - Dependent pattern matching

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
definition map {A B C : Type} (f : A → B → C)
     : Π {n : nat}, vector A n → vector B n → vector C n
| map nil     nil     := nil
| map (a::va) (b::vb) := f a b :: map va vb

definition zip {A B : Type}
     : Π {n}, vector A n → vector B n → vector (A × B) n
| zip nil nil         := nil
| zip (a::va) (b::vb) := (a, b) :: zip va vb
#+END_SRC

* Definitional Reductions

  - Elaborator must respect the computational interpretation of terms
  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  example (A : Type) (a b : A) : (a, b).1 = a :=
  rfl

  example (A B : Type) (f : A → A → B) (a : A) :
          (λ x, f x x) a = f a a :=
  rfl
  #+END_SRC

* Coercions

  - In Lean, we can associate *attributes* to definitions.
  - *Coercion* is one of the available attributes.

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  variable {A : Type}

  definition to_list [coercion] : ∀ {n : nat}, vector A n → list A
  | 0      nil    := nil
  | (n+1)  (a::v) := a::(to_list v)

  variable f : list nat → Prop
  variable v : vector nat 10
  check f v  -- f (@to_list nat 10 v)
  #+END_SRC

* Namespaces

  - We can group definitions, metadata (e.g., notation declarations and attributes) into namespaces.
  - We can *open* namespaces

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  namespace foo
    definition f (a : nat) := nat.succ a
    eval f nat.zero
  end foo

  eval foo.f nat.zero
  open foo
  eval f nat.zero

  open nat
  check 1 + 2

  open nat (hiding add sub)
  open nat (renaming add → nadd)
  open nat (rec_on)
  open [notations] nat
  open -[classes] nat
  #+END_SRC

* Ad-hoc polymorphism

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  notation a + b := add a b
  notation a + b := bor a b

  eval 1 + 2
  eval tt + ff
  #+END_SRC

  - We can use namespaces to avoid unwanted ambiguity.
  - We can *override* overloading

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  check (#nat a + b)
  #+END_SRC

* Human-readable proofs

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
import algebra.category
open eq.ops category functor natural_transformation

variables {ob₁ ob₂ : Type} {C : category ob₁}
          {D : category ob₂} {F G H : C ⇒ D}
definition nt_compose (η : G ⟹ H) (θ : F ⟹ G) : F ⟹ H :=
natural_transformation.mk
  (take a, η a ∘ θ a)
  (take a b f, calc
    H f ∘ (η a ∘ θ a) = (H f ∘ η a) ∘ θ a : assoc
                  ... = (η b ∘ G f) ∘ θ a : naturality
                  ... = η b ∘ (G f ∘ θ a) : assoc
                  ... = η b ∘ (θ b ∘ F f) : naturality
                  ... = (η b ∘ θ b) ∘ F f : assoc
#+END_SRC

* Type classes

  - *Synthesis* procedure based on *lambda-Prolog*

  - Big picture
    - Mark some inductive families as *classes*
    - Mark some definitions as (generators of) *instances*
    - Indicate that some implicit arguments must be synthesized using type classes

  - *Instances* are treated as *Horn clauses*

* Inhabited Type Class

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  inductive inhabited [class] (A : Type) : Type :=
  mk : A → inhabited A

  definition default (A : Type) [h : inhabited A] : A :=
  inhabited.rec (λ a, a) h

  definition prop_inhabited [instance] : inhabited Prop :=
  inhabited.mk true

  definition nat_inhabited [instance] : inhabited nat :=
  inhabited.mk nat.zero

  definition fun_inhabited [instance]
     (A B : Type) [h : inhabited B] : inhabited (A → B) :=
  inhabited.mk (λ x : A, default B)

  definition prod_inhabited [instance]
        (A B : Type) [ha : inhabited A] [hb : inhabited B] :
        inhabited (A × B) :=
  inhabited.mk (default A, default B)

  eval default (nat → nat × Prop)
  -- ⇒ λ (a : ℕ), (0, true)
  #+END_SRC

* Decidable Type Class

- An element of =Prop= is said to be
decidable if we can decide whether it is true or false.

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
inductive decidable [class] (p : Prop) : Type :=
| inl :  p → decidable p
| inr : ¬p → decidable p
#+END_SRC

- Having an element =t : decidable p= is stronger than having an element =t : p ∨ ¬p=

- The expression =if c then t else e= contains an implicit argument =[d : decidable c]=.

- If Hilbert's choice is imported, then all propositions are decidable (smooth transition to classical reasoning).

* Decidable Type Class

#+BEGIN_SRC lean
definition ball (n : nat) (P : nat → Prop) : Prop :=
∀ x, x < n → P x

definition dec_ball [instance] [H : decidable_pred P]
           : Π (n : nat), decidable (ball n P)
| dec_ball 0     := inl (ball_zero P)
| dec_ball (a+1) :=
  match dec_ball a with
  | inl iH  :=
      match H a with
      | inl Pa  := inl (ball_succ_of_ball iH Pa)
      | inr nPa := inr (not_ball_of_not nPa)
      end
  | inr niH := inr (not_ball_succ_of_not_ball niH)
  end

definition is_constant_range (f : nat → nat) (n : nat) : bool :=
if ∀ i, i < n → f i = f 0 then tt else ff
#+END_SRC

* Tactics

  - Automation such as rewrite engined, simplifiers and decision procedures are integrated into
    the system as tactics.
  - A placeholder/hole can be viewed as a *goal*
  - A *proof state* is a sequence of goals, substitution (already solved holes), and postponed constraints.
  - A *tactic* is a function from proof state to a *lazy stream of proof states* (very similar to Isabelle).
  - *Tacticals* are tactic combinadors: *andthen*, *orelse*, *par*, ...

* Tactics

  - We can switch to *tactic mode* using *begin ... end* or *by ...*

  #+BEGIN_SRC lean
  example (p q : Prop) (Hp : p) (Hq : q) : p ∧ q ∧ p :=
  begin

  example (H₁ : a + 0 = 0) (H₂ : b + 0 = 0)
          : a + b + 0 = 0 :=
  begin
    rewrite add_zero at *,
    rewrite [H₁, H₂]
  end
  #+END_SRC

* Structures

  - Special kind of inductive datatype (only one constructor)
  - Projections are generated automatically
  - "Inheritance"
  - Extensively used to formalize the algebraic hierarchy
  - We can view them as *parametric modules*

* Future work

  - *Auto* tactic based on equational reasoning, matching, heuristic instantiation, ...
  - *Decision procedures* for arithmetic
  - Efficient evaluator
  - Better support for *proof by reflection*
  - Better libraries (ongoing work)
  - Machine learning (ask Daniel)
