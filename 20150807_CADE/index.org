* Introduction: *Lean*

- New *open source* theorem prover
- Platform for
  - *Software* verification & development
  - Formalized *mathematics*
  - *Education* (mathematics, logic, computer science)
  - *Synthesis* (proofs & programs)
- de Bruijn's Principle: *small trusted kernel*
- Expressive logic based on *dependent type theory*
- Partial constructions: automation fills the "holes"

* Introduction: *Lean*

- It is an ongoing and *long long term* effort
- At CMU, it is already being used for formalizing
  - Homotopy Type Theory
  - Category Theory
  - Algebraic Hierarchy
  - [[https://github.com/javra/msc-thesis][Nonabelian Algebraic Topology]]
  - Number Theory
- [[http://leanprover.github.io/tutorial][Interactive theory proving course]] at CMU
- Haitao Zhang is formalizing [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/theories/group_theory/group_theory.md][Group Theory]]
- Floris van Doorn implemented [[https://github.com/fpvandoorn/leansnippets/blob/master/propositional_truncation.hlean][propositional truncation as a non-recursive HIT]]

* Main Goal

*Lean aims to bring two worlds together*

- An interactive theorem prover with powerful automation
- An automated reasoning tool that
  - produces (detailed) proofs,
  - has a rich language,
  - can be used interactively, and
  - is built on a verified mathematical library

* Secondary Goals

- *Minimalist* and *high-performace* kernel

- *Experiment* with different flavors of type theory
  - Proof irrelevant vs Proof relevant
  - Impredicative vs Predicative
  - Higher Inductive Types
  - Quotient Types
  - Observational Type Theory

- *Have Fun*

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle
  - Higher-order unification
  - Definitional reductions
  - Coercions
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (aka overloading)
  - Type classes
  - Tactics

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to
   concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the
   race."
       -- A. N. Whitehead
#+END_QUOTE

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle
- Small *trusted* kernel
  - It does *not* contain
    - Termination checker
    - Fixpoint operators
    - Pattern matching
    - Module management
  - [[https://github.com/leanprover/tc][Reference type checker]]
    - Implemented by Daniel Selsam
    - < 2000 lines of Haskell code
    - Code is easy to read and understand
    - Type check the whole standard library (35K lines) under 2 mins
  - All Lean files can be exported in a very simple format
    - [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/export_format.md][Documentation is available on github]]

  - Process theorems in parallel
  - Execute/try tactics (automation) in parallel

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle

* What is new?

- Poweful *elaboration engine* that can handle
- Small *trusted* kernel

* Two official libraries

- *Standard*
  - Proof irrelevant and impredicative Prop
  - Smooth transition to classical logic
  - Inductive Families
  - Quotient Types

- *HoTT*
  - Proof relevant and no impredicative Prop
  - Univalence axiom
  - Inductive Families
  - HIT

- Easy to implement experimental versions,
  Example: [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/issues/523][Steve Awodey asked for proof relevant and impredicative universe]]


* Recursive equations

  - *Recursors* are *inconvenient* to use.
  - Compiler from *recursive equations* into *recursors*.
  - Two compilation strategies: *structural* and *well-founded* recursion

* Structures

  - Special kind of inductive datatype (only one constructor)
  - Projections are generated automatically
  - "Inheritance"
  - Extensively used to formalize the algebraic hierarchy
  - We can view them as *parametric modules*

  (mul : A → A → A)

  structure semigroup [class] (A : Type) extends has_mul A :=

  ...

  structure group [class] (A : Type) extends monoid A, has_inv A :=
  (mul_left_inv : ∀a, mul (inv a) a = one)
