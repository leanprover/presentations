This repository was once used to host presentations about Lean. It remains to keep links alive and for historical interest.

The gh-pages branch contains rendered versions of the presentations, hosted online. It has been manually updated, rather than automatically in CI.

At the time of archival (2024-01-25), we are hosting the site on Netlify. The deployment GitHub Action can be invoked manually if this site ever needs updating.

Here are the former contents of the README:
